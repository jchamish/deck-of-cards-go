A Simple Deck of Cards

Differents between Maps and Struct
Maps 
* All Keys must be the same type
* Use to represent a collection of related properties
* All values must be the same type
* Don't need to know all the keys at compile time
* Keys are indexed - we can iterate over them
* Reference Type!

Struct
* Values can be of diferent type
* You need to know all the differen fields at compile time
* Keys don't support indexing
* Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties
* Value Type!
